 # Amazon EC2 Instance Types Overview

| Instance Type               | Description                                              | Use Cases                                                    | Sources                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **General Purpose Instances** | Balanced compute, memory, and networking resources.       | Web servers, app servers, and small to medium databases.      | [AWS - General Purpose Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/general-purpose/)                       |
| **Compute Optimized Instances**| High-performance processors, ideal for compute-bound applications. | Compute-bound applications, gaming servers, and scientific modeling. | [AWS - Compute Optimized Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/compute-optimized/)         |
| **Memory Optimized Instances** | High memory-to-CPU ratio, suitable for memory-intensive applications. | In-memory databases, real-time big data analytics, and large-scale SAP HANA. | [AWS - Memory Optimized Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/memory-optimized/)           |
| **Accelerated Computing Instances** | Hardware accelerators or co-processors for tasks like GPU or FPGA. | Machine learning, graphics processing, and data compression.  | [AWS - Accelerated Computing Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/accelerated-computing/) |
| **Storage Optimized Instances** | High, low-latency storage capacity.                        | NoSQL databases, data warehousing, and distributed file systems. | [AWS - Storage Optimized Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/storage-optimized/)   |

This classification allows users to choose instances tailored to their specific workload requirements, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.
